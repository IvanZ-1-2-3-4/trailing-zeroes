# trailing-zeroes
How many zeros are there in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n!"> (n factorial)?
I started thinking about this puzzle when someone asked me how many trailing zeros are there in 100 factorial, which I then generalised to ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%21). This applet is just something to verify that my hypothesis was true.

### Explanation
A number with trailing zeros has as many factors of 10 as it has trailing zeros. This means we can solve the problem of counting how many trailing zeros are in  <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n!"> by counting the number of tens that go into <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n!">. This is a much simpler problem.
