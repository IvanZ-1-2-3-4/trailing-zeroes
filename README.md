# trailing-zeroes
How many zeros are there in ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%21) (n factorial)?
I started thinking about this puzzle when someone asked me how many trailing zeros are there in 100 factorial, which I then generalised to ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%21). This applet is just something to verify that my hypothesis was true.

### Explanation
A number with trailing zeros has as many factors of 10 as it has trailing zeros. This means we can solve the problem of counting how many trailing zeros are in ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%21) by counting the number of tens that go into ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?n%21). This is a much simpler problem.
